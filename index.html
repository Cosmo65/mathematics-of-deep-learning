      <h1>The Mathematics of Deep Learning</h1>

      <h3>SIPB IAP 2018</h3>

      <h3>Thu Jan 18 05:00pm - 09:00pm in 4-237</h3>

      <p>Learn the key ideas that make deep learning work.</p>

      <p>This class focuses on teaching the mathematical ideas that make deep
      learning tractable and teaching how to think about deep representations
      and neural network function approximation.</p>

      <p>As we introduce the mathematics, we'll work through implementing
      simple neural networks and training algorithms from scratch in NumPy.
      While teaching higher-level ideas, we'll switch to using TensorFlow's
      high-level interface for programming more sophisticated neural networks
      without having to think about computing derivatives manually. Finally,
      we'll introduce cutting-edge ideas from deep learning research and try to
      replicate some of the latest results ourselves.</p>

      <h2>RSVP</h2>

      <p>If you're coming, please RSVP
      <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/lTl5ejUtAY4RJKZQ2">here</a> (preferred) or
      email <a href="mailto:aathalye@mit.edu">aathalye@mit.edu</a>.</p>

      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>

      <p>Multivariable calculus required (be comfortable with partial
      derivatives and the multivariate
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule">chain rule</a>), and
      linear algebra recommended. Some familiarity with Python, NumPy, and
      TensorFlow recommended.</p>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>

      <p>Install the following software:</p>

      <p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Notebook</a> (with a Python 3
          kernel)</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.numpy.org/">NumPy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> (install
          <code>tensorflow-gpu</code> if you have a GPU that supports
          CUDA)</li>
        <li><a href="https://python-pillow.org/">Pillow</a></li>
      </ul>
      </p>

      <p>Installing these packages can be a bit of a pain, so if you prefer,
      you can use a
      <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a>
      VM
      <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/g1srsu8aeur239n/deeplearning.ova?dl=0">image</a>
      (username and password both
      <code>deeplearning</code>) that has all the software preinstalled.</p>

      <p>To make sure you've installed everything properly, make sure you can
      execute the following code in a Jupyter Notebook:</p>

<pre>
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from scipy.misc import imsave

sess = tf.InteractiveSession()

x = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, (1,))
print((x*x).eval({x: np.array([3])})) # this should print "[ 9.]"
</pre>

      <p>It's highly recommended that you try playing around with Jupyter
      Notebook before the class.</p>

      <h2>Materials</h2>

      <p>Class materials will be available at
      <a href="https://github.com/anishathalye/mathematics-of-deep-learning">github.com/anishathalye/mathematics-of-deep-learning</a>
      closer to the day of the class.</p>
