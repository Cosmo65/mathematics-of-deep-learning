# The Mathematics of Deep Learning

## SIPB IAP, 18 January 2018

### Anish Athalye (aathalye@)

[anish.io/deeplearning](http://www.anish.io/deeplearning)

???

* Taught as part of SIPB IAP - you can go to SIPB's website to see our other
IAP offerings.

* All materials available on the website, including slides and code (and
eventually, lecture video).

# Goals

* Demystify deep learning

* Change the way you think about programming

]

???

* I'm not going to spend time up front talking about why deep learning is cool
or anything like that. Presumably you're here because you've heard about some
of the neat applications and you want to learn how it works.

* Deep learning is a pretty shallow field, so even if you want to get
up-to-date with the state-of-the-art, it's not that hard.

* At its core, it's basically high school math, some programming tricks, and a
neat way of thinking about problems.

* By the end of this lecture, you should be able to fully understand what's
going on when you're training a deep neural net, down to the floating-point
multiplies and adds. No more treating TensorFlow as a magical black box.

* Please ask lots of questions as we go.

A couple disclaimers:

* We're mostly talking about how deep learning works, not why it works: we
aren't going to be talking about questions like why deep neural nets converge
to good minima, and so on. This is partly cause we have only four hours, and
partly because the machine learning community doesn't yet have complete answers
to many of these hard theoretical questions.

* Also, of course, we can't cover all of deep learning in a four hour class,
though we'll cover the fundamental mathematical ideas. If you fully understand
all the material from this class, you should be able to go straight to reading
research papers and learning all about the state-of-the-art.

???

* Okay, so let's talk about artifical neurons...

---

???

* Actually, just kidding, let's put that off for an hour or so.

* Artificial neurons are one piece of the puzzle, and it's not the right place
to start. I want to give you a good mental model for thinking about deep
learning and optimization, so we're going to develop those ideas first.

* As far as I know, the organization of this class is very different from a lot
of the intro deep learning classes I've heard about. The goal is to make sure
we cover the hard-to-learn big ideas in addition to the easy-to-learn details.
So as we go through the course, focus more on the big ideas: you can always
revisit the course material (it's all available online) to refer to details.

# Agenda

1. Key ideas, pt. 1: program search, computational graphs, and backpropagation

1. Key ideas, pt. 2: search spaces

1. Hands on: adversarial examples, transfer learning

1. Wrap-up

???

* First, we'll talk about machine learning as a search for a solution over a
space of programs, and we'll talk about using gradient descent using
backpropagation to perform an efficient search.

* Next, we'll talk more about how we choose the spaces to search over, aka
network architectures.

* Throughout both of these parts, you should have a piece of paper handy and
also have your laptop open - you should follow along as we go through
mathematical derivations or as we implement code.

* After we go through the main ideas, we'll talk briefly about one current
research area and one neat application, and then you'll have a chance to
experiment with one or both of them in a workshop-style session.

* Finally, we'll wrap up and talk about resources you can use to learn more
about deep learning.

* We'll have short breaks in between these sessions.
